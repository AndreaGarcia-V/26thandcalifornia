# 26th and California

A Backbone-based app to browse and visualize data from the Supreme
Chi-Town Coding Crew's [Cook County Jail API](http://cookcountyjail.recoveredfactory.net/api/1.0/?format=json) 
([source](https://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail)).

# Getting started

Clone the repository:

``` 
git clone git://github.com/sc3/26thandcalifornia.git 
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Firefox+Firebug or Chrome
are highly recommended.

Open `index.html` in your text editor. We're off to the races.

# A tour of the app

Let's take a whirlwind tour of the app. We'll mostly follow the execution 
order of our application from the time `index.html` is opened in the browser.

The application layout is heavily based on ["Organizing your application
using Modules](http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/) 
by Thomas Davis.


## index.html

`index.html` is almost (see ticket XX) trivially short.

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/sc3/26thandcalifornia/raw/master/index.html"></script>

## main.js

## app.js

## models

## collections
